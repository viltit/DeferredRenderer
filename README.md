a work-in-Progress Renderer for OpenGL, written mainly for learning purposes

To Do:
<ul>
<li><b>rework Scene manager. Its messy! </b></li>
<li>Transparent objects, Scene Manager: Use the center of the aabb for distance comparing</li>
<li>reduce dir shadow acne</li>
</ul>

Ideas
<ul>
<li>Let the material decide what shader is to be used (may be easyier to make materials more flexible this way, ie normal-mapping, specular-mapping, later maybe bump-mapping)</li>
</ul>
